# Shortbread
A lightweight directory/folder management system written in the C language.
## Overview
It is common for directories to become clogged with unused files, or duplicates of files - wasting valuable space. The epitome of this problem is the downloads directory, often a user will download a file just to be read once, which remains on the system. Shortbread allows simple file operations to be performed on individual or groups of files with user-friendly commands. These can also be stored as a list of rules which are all executed using a single command to format a directory in a specific way.
## Features
* Copy files to another location
* Delete unwanted files
* List all files in a directory
* Autorun a set of user-specified rules for quick formatting
## To do
* Update command targets so that files with same extension can be grouped
* Provide more information when listing files
* Improve error handling
* Port code to be used on non-Linux systems
