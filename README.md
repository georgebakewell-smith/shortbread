# Shortbread
A lightweight directory/folder management system written in the C language.
## Overview
It is common for directories to become clogged with unused files, or duplicates of files - wasting valuable space. The epitome of this problem is the downloads directory, often a user will download a file just to be read once, which remains on the system. Shortbread allows simple file operations to be performed on individual or groups of files with user-friendly commands. These can also be stored as a list of rules which are all executed using a single command to format a directory in a specific way.
